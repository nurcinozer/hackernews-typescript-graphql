    t.nonNull.int("id"); // 3 This adds a field named id of type Int

    t.nonNull.string("url"); // 5 This adds a field named url of type String

      type: "User",

In the query, you are fetching the link record first using findUnique({ where: { id: parent.id } }) and then the associated user relation who posted the link by chaining postedBy().

Every field on each type (including the root types) has a resolver function which is executed to get the return value when fetching that type. For now, our resolver implementation is very simple, it just returns the links array. The resolve function has four arguments, parent, args, context and info. We will get to these later.
